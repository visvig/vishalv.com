Hi, I’m Vishal. I work in strategy consulting, and I spend a lot of my time trying to understand how things fit together in markets, technology, and life in general. I learn by writing, so this site is my place to think in public and keep track of what I’m exploring.

Outside of work, I read, lift, experiment with side projects, and follow my curiosity. This site is a work in progress, just like me, and I’m slowly adding to it as I figure things out.
