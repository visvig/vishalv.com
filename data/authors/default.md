Hey, I’m Vishal.

I’m a mechanical engineering and data science graduate from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, and I’m now a Strategy & Business Design Analyst at Monitor Deloitte.

I’ve always geeked out on science and technology. In college, being around people building serious tech and research projects got me hooked on startups. I began to find it more fun to think about the “next big thing” and which startups would end up playing a big role in it. It’s interesting to compare notes with friends in the venture space about the bets these budding companies are placing, but I wouldn’t say I don’t enjoy digging into the science behind what they’re building.

This site is where I keep a log of what I’m thinking, learning, or ideas I want to return to later. It might also contain my other interests like reading classics or lifting heavy.

Stick around for reasonably structured narratives :)
