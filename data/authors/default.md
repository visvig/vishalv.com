Hey, I’m Vishal.

I am a mechanical engineering and data science graduate from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras and now work in strategy consulting at Monitor Deloitte.

I have always been drawn to science and technology, and I’ve always seen it as the place where world-changing ideas originate. From a value-creation point of view, I believe fundamental contributions matter the most, and that belief shapes the way I look at innovation. I enjoy understanding how teams around the world, including DeepTech start-ups and research labs, turn technical breakthroughs into real businesses.

Outside work, I am usually on X or speaking with friends in the VC space about the bets these companies are placing. This site is where I keep log of what I’m thinking, learning, or simply what I want to return to later.

I’m early in my career and still shaping the path ahead. This space will keep evolving as I do.
