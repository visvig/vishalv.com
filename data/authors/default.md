Hey, I’m Vishal.

I am a mechanical engineering and data science graduate from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras and now work in strategy consulting at Monitor Deloitte.

I’ve always loved following technology, and now I’m just as interested in which ideas have the highest potential to create value. That’s why I enjoy learning about teams around the world, particularly DeepTech start-ups and research labs, and how they turn hard technical feats into real businesses. It’s always interesting to compare notes with friends in the VC space about the bets these companies are placing.

This site is where I keep a log of what I’m thinking, learning, or simply what I want to return to later. It might also contain my other interests like reading classics or lifting heavy.

Stick around for a reasonably structured narrative around these areas :)
