Hi, I’m Vishal. I graduated from IIT Madras and now work in strategy consulting. I enjoy solving problems and getting to clarity in situations that are often messy. Writing helps me think straight, so this site is where I keep track of what I’m learning and the work in progress.

I’m early in my career and still shaping the path ahead. This site will keep evolving as I do.
