          "raw": "\nDavid Foster Wallace’s _Brief Interviews with Hideous Men_, published in 1999, is less a collection of short stories than a sustained examination of self-awareness as masquerade. It contains twenty-three formally diverse pieces (monologues, metafictional thought experiments, impressionistic fragments, and one-sided interviews), all orbiting a recurring figure: the man who speaks at length in the direction of sincerity, yet circles endlessly in performance, deflection, and delusion.\n## Overview\n\nCritics have long noted the book’s formal restlessness. Wallace moves between narrative modes like a novelist demonstrating range: the titular interviews are printed without the interviewer’s questions; other stories mimic pop-psych surveys, or collapse into metafictional spirals. The effect is disorienting by design. What emerges is less a sequence of narratives than a cartography of male self-justification.\n\nThe men Wallace presents are rarely monstrous in the conventional sense. They’re articulate, fluent in the language of guilt, and often disturbingly aware of their shortcomings. Their hideousness lies in the ease with which they convert that awareness into camouflage, self-knowledge weaponized to avoid transformation.\n\n## The Interviews\n\nThe “Brief Interviews” chapters, which give the collection its name, are the clearest examples. Stripped of any external voice, these transcripts leave only the men’s answers. Critics have pointed out the importance of this silence; how the unseen, unheard interviewer (almost always female) becomes a stand-in for the reader, or for an absent judge. The men fill this silence compulsively. Some perform virtue. Others confess, but in the self-congratulatory manner of men who’ve learned that contrition, too, can be a form of control.\n\nAs Matthew Alexander observes, the male speakers in these stories don’t suffer from a lack of language but are consumed by it. Their compulsive verbosity, directed at a passive female listener, becomes its own form of evasion: a way to expose flaws without accountability. Rather than fostering change, this language collapses into a performance of insight.\n\nWallace, through these monologues, stages not only the breakdown of modern masculinity, but the way introspection itself can harden into yet another pose.\n\n## Standout Stories\n\nThat idea of what I would phrase the vanity of knowing, runs through the strongest stories in the collection.\n\n**The Depressed Person** is a particularly difficult piece. It is a long, claustrophobic monologue by a woman so saturated with therapeutic self-awareness that she becomes incapable of human connection. Critics have called it cruel. I think it’s exacting. Wallace doesn’t mock her condition so much as anatomize the recursive solipsism of modern suffering. The pain is real. So is the performance of that pain. And Wallace, to his credit, refuses to resolve the contradiction.\n\n**Octet**, perhaps the most openly metafictional story in the book, breaks the narrative altogether. It begins as a series of “pop quizzes”, basically moral vignettes meant to implicate the reader; but soon collapses into a direct address (think _Fleabag_). Wallace stops pretending. He tells us he’s failing to write something sincere, and then tries again, in increasingly desperate revisions. The story becomes recursive: an artifact about its own inability to mean. Few critics dwell on _Octet_, but it strikes me as the Rosetta Stone of the collection. It reveals Wallace’s own struggle to write truthfully in a culture where performance is indistinguishable from confession.\n\nThen there’s **Think**, a tightly framed encounter between a married man and his wife’s younger sister. The story unfolds in real time, saturated with the man’s interior calculations: how he might look kneeling before her, what she might be reenacting from a movie, how catalog imagery overlays real life. She is topless. He kneels. But instead of seduction, he clasps his hands and begins to pray. The gesture is ambiguous (we don’t know if it’s religious, erotic, or theatrical), and she stands, arms crossed, increasingly unsure how to respond. “It’s not what you think,” he says. Then again, it never is. What _Think_ captures so well is the psychic split between perceived meaning and real intent. The man imagines how he appears, how she appears, how the entire scene might be read by her, by himself, by some invisible third eye.\n\nHis prayer becomes another gesture in a media-soaked tableau. Even the woman begins to wonder whether to join him, unsure not just of what is happening, but of what it would even mean to echo his pose.\n\n## Where the Form Falters\n\nThe collection is not without flaws. “Church Not Made with Hands” is a symbolic fog really; it’s linguistically dense but emotionally opaque.\n\nCritics have described it as abstract and self-contained, and I would agree. It feels like an exercise rather than an offering. There are other such moments, where Wallace’s brilliance lapses into bravura. The style overtakes the insight. The structure becomes the subject. And while this is thematically consistent, it mirrors the characters’ tendency to talk instead of feel. And to a reader it can grow tiring.\n\nOne critic noted that Wallace sometimes “moralizes with such gravity” that the irony loses tension. In weaker stories, the reader becomes more aware of Wallace’s technical gymnastics than the human moments they are meant to contain.\n\n## What Can The Interviewer’s Absence Mean?\n\nFeminist critics and #MeToo-era reappraisals have turned renewed attention to the book’s portrayal of gender. Wallace’s decision to silence the female interviewer is not incidental. It reframes the stories not simply as testimonies, but as performances against a deliberately vacant listener. The men speak, unchecked, because no one interrupts them. They are narrators in a vacuum, and that vacuum becomes part of the indictment.\n\nStories like “Brief Interview #2,” which recounts an ambiguous rape scenario, have drawn attention for their refusal to signal the narrator’s guilt directly. But scholars such as Rachel Haley Himmelheber have argued that Wallace’s method is precisely this: to withhold moral cues, to leave the reader unsettled in ambiguity. The horror, in these stories, lies in what is not contested. The men tell their stories unopposed and indict themselves more thoroughly than any outside commentary could.\n\nWallace himself once wrote that misogyny among men often reflects a deeper fear: of women’s autonomy, rejection, or unknowability. The collection reflects this fear not by dramatizing male villainy, but by mapping male evasion.\n\n## Knowing Without Changing\n\nThis is a book that dramatizes language as a defense mechanism. Its men speak as if performance were redemption. They confess without consequence. And Wallace, despite (or because of) his proximity to their psychology, refuses to let them off the hook.\n\nAcross the strongest stories, Wallace documents a particular cognitive pattern, what we might now call the “wellness-adjacent narcissist”: the person who speaks eloquently about their flaws in order to avoid actually changing. The pain is real, yes. The insight may be hard-won. But the language of growth, in Wallace’s hands, is too often a script rehearsed in private.\n\nCritics like Steven Moore and Zadie Smith have praised the book for capturing this paralysis—how the modern intellect, armed with irony, folds in on itself.\n\nAnd this paralysis has found new avatars. The rise of #literallyme characters—men who are often antisocial, hyper-self-aware, and incapable of change—reveals something unsettling about male identification today. These men are outcasts, narcissists, or sociopaths, yet are idolized precisely for their unfiltered performances of thought. What’s admired isn’t their redemption, but their refusal of it.\n\nWallace’s men belong in this lineage. They’re not tragic because they are evil but because they know exactly what they’re doing. The most frightening thing this book reveals about us is the possibility that we can understand everything we are doing, and continue anyway.\n",

          "raw": "\n> Jury — a group of members of the public in a court of law who listen to the facts about a crime and decide if somebody is guilty or not guilty.\n\nConsider a 3-man jury: two serious ones and a joker. We’re assuming the probability of each serious juror independently making the correct judgment is _p_, and the joker makes a random decision (with a probability of 0.5 for being correct since their decision is random, like flipping a coin).\n\n### Two Serious Jurors Agree\n\n- Both Correct: Probability is _p_×_p_=_p²_.\n- Both Incorrect: Probability is (1−_p_)×(1−_p_)=(1−_p_)_²._\n\n### Two Serious Jurors Disagree\n\n- One is correct, and the other is incorrect. The probability for this scenario is 2×_p_×(1−_p_), as this can happen in two ways (Juror 1 is correct and Juror 2 is incorrect, or vice versa).\n\n### Jury Decision with Joker\n\n1. Both Serious Jurors Agree: The decision is already made, irrespective of the joker’s vote. The probability that this decision is correct is _p²_, and the probability that it’s incorrect is (1−_p_)_²_.\n2. Serious Jurors Disagree: The decision falls to the joker, effectively a random decision. The probability of a correct decision is 0.5, and incorrect is also 0.5.\n\n### Probability of Correct Jury Decision\n\n- When the serious jurors agree, the probability of a correct decision is _p²_.\n- When they disagree, the decision is a coin flip (0.5 chance of being correct). The probability of them disagreeing is 2×_p_×(1−_p_), so the contribution to the overall probability of a correct decision is 0.5×2×_p_×(1−_p_)=_p_(1−_p_).\n\nTherefore, the total probability of a correct decision by the 3-person jury is _p²_+_p_(1−_p_) = _p._\n\n### Compared with One Serious Juror\n\nA single serious juror has a probability _p_ of making the correct decision. So, A 3-man jury with a Joker is just as reasonable as a 1-man jury.\n\n### Why do Batman and Gordon need Two-Face?\n\nWithout _Two-Face_ (referred to as _Joker_ in this article), the jury (_Batman_ and _Gordon_) can only make a correct decision when both agree, which has a probability of _p²_.\n\n- With Two-Face: The probability of a correct decision is _p_.\n- Without Two-Face: The probability is _p²_.\n\nComparing these two probabilities demonstrates that the inclusion of _Harvey Dent,_ aka _Two-Face,_ in the jury increases the overall probability of making a correct decision. The addition of _Two-Face’s_ random decision-making paradoxically, enhances the jury’s effectiveness in scenarios where _Batman_ and _Gordon_ disagree.\n\nIt's fascinating how a chance element can enhance the results of group decision-making.\n\nThis problem was adapted from the book “50 Challenging Problems in Probability.”",

          "raw": "## Why’s It Called a Red Flag?\n\nIn 1980, when John Lennon was shot dead outside the Dakota, the man who pulled the trigger, Mark David Chapman, did not flee the scene. Nor did he cry or scream or pretend to be confused. He just sat down on the sidewalk and opened a copy of _The Catcher in the Rye_. The book was in his hands when the cops got to him.\n\nWhen asked why he murdered Lennon, he gave a strange kind of answer that still echoes uncomfortably today: “Read the book.”\n\nEver since then, _The Catcher in the Rye_ has carried a weird, haunted reputation. It is still considered a literary classic, still found on syllabi, still sold in every bookstore worth the name, but there is always a shadow hanging around it. Readers call it overrated, too whiny, too adolescent. And more recently, even worse, they have started calling it a “red flag.”\n\nYou know the type. The dating profiles that say, “If he says his favorite book is _Catcher in the Rye_, run.” And this is where I start to get annoyed. Because when someone says that, they are not really talking about the book. They are talking about the kind of guy they think reads it—the kind who thinks brooding counts as depth, who identifies Holden Caulfield as a personality trait, and never realizes the whole novel is about being lost as a teen and not having the language to say how you feel.\n\nWhich is exactly the kind of misunderstanding Holden Caulfield would have seen coming from a mile away. And this book does not deserve to be labelled a “red flag.” Here is why.\n\n## Holden Does Not Want to Be Your Hero\n\nFrom the very beginning, Holden makes it clear he is not trying to impress you. He is not writing a polished story about growth. He is not giving you a roadmap for healing. In fact, he does not even want to be seen. He is just talking to you (or me) the way someone does when they are tired and sad and a little bit scared, but still too proud to admit it.\n\nHe lies constantly, but only because the truth never really works out for him. He keeps reaching out to people—former teachers, old girlfriends, even complete strangers—hoping one of them might get him, even for a second. They do not. They talk over him, walk away, or treat him like a kid going through a phase.\n\nAnd maybe he is. But that does not make the pain any smaller.\n\n## The Second Someone Swings, He Folds\n\nThere is something heartbreaking about the way Holden tries to puff himself up in certain moments, talking about how he would punch someone or how much someone “kills” him. But when the actual fights come—and they do, more than once—he does not stand a chance. Stradlater flattens him instantly. Maurice, the elevator guy, roughs him up without breaking a sweat. When he tries to argue with people like Sally Hayes or Carl Luce, they brush him off or leave.\n\n## His Coping Mechanisms Are Harmless Symbols\n\nThe red hunting hat is not some quirky detail. It is the one thing he has control over. He puts it on when he wants to feel invisible or untouchable. He takes it off when he is ashamed or scared. It is armor he knows does not work, but he wears it anyway.\n\nThe ducks in Central Park, the ones he keeps asking about and wondering where they go in the winter, are his way of asking a deeper question he does not know how to form. What happens when the place that used to hold you stops making sense? Do you disappear? Or do you find some way to return?\n\nThe Museum of Natural History, the place where everything stays exactly the same, is the world Holden wishes he lived in. A frozen world. A safe world. A place where nothing has to die or grow up or leave. Allie’s glove—the poems written on it—you do not need me to explain that. It already says everything.\n\nAll the symbols people love pointing to are not symbols for Holden. They are coping mechanisms.\n\n## The Carousel Ending\n\nThere is this moment at the very end of the book, and if you have read it, you remember it. Holden is sitting on a bench in the rain, watching his sister Phoebe ride the carousel. He does not say anything profound. He does not have a big revelation. He just watches her go around and around, and something in him settles.\n\nFor once, he is not trying to run. He is not lying. He is not interrupting. He is simply there. Watching someone he loves be happy, and letting it happen. It is the smallest thing. And it is everything.\n\n## On the Author\n\nJ. D. Salinger never let them turn it into a movie. Not because nobody tried. Everyone tried. Spielberg. Jerry Lewis. Even Harvey Weinstein, long before anyone knew what he was. Offers poured in constantly, and Salinger turned them all down. Because here is the truth: Holden’s voice cannot be acted.\n\nSalinger spent most of his life avoiding the spotlight. After the book blew up, he retreated to a cabin in New Hampshire and lived there, mostly unseen, for decades. No press. No interviews. Like Holden, he was not trying to be a symbol or a brand or even a genius. He just did not want anyone to mess with what he had already said.\n\n## So Is It a Red Flag?\n\nOnly if you think sadness is an aesthetic. Only if you have not read the book since high school and only remember the part where he says “phony.” But if someone tells you this is their favorite book, and they are not just trying to sound edgy—if they talk about the ducks, or the museum, or how the carousel made them cry in a quiet way they did not expect—maybe stop and ask what part of Holden they saw in themselves.\n\nBecause that is the part they are really showing you. And if you see it—if you really see it—that is not a red flag. That is the empathy Salinger might have wished someone had for him when he was a teen.\n",

          "raw": "\nAlways been a bit of a science geek, but my last real quantum encounter was with that _Black Mirror_ episode, _Joan is Awful_. Then, out of nowhere, I found myself deep in a book on quantum mechanics, a book that used to be just confusing jargon to me. Thanks to some college Li.   near Algebra, it’s started making sense. It’s weirdly thrilling, to realize that quantum mechanics is not just sci-fi stuff — it’s real, and it’s so weird.\n\n### What’s exactly “weird”?\n\nEveryone talks about Quantum Mechanics as this weird world where a cat can be both dead and alive, and particles are playing dice games. But when you really get down to it, most people can’t explain _how_ it's weird beyond these buzzwords like entanglement, tunneling etc.\n\nLeonard Susskind, a renowned theoretical physicist, and Art Friedman, a data consultant who also happens to be one of Leonard’s students and, crucially, a fiddle player—teamed up to write _‘The Theoretical Minimum Vol.2: Quantum Mechanics’_ back in 2014. It’s been a few years, but don’t dismiss it as outdated. This book is still one of the best resources to understand Quantum Mechanics — without the hand-waving.\n\nCurious about what freaked Einstein out about ‘spooky action’? Want to get your head around the Uncertainty Principle? This book breaks it down.\n\n### The Book Overview\n\nIt’s not exactly Pop-Sci. It looks like one, especially with that cover and size, but it’s quite different from any pop-sci book I’ve read. The pages are filled with math. No, don't run away now — as it turns out, that’s how you really start doing Quantum Mechanics.\n\nThe book integrates the necessary math in separate sections, allowing readers to choose their level of engagement. It starts with state vectors and operators, using bra-ket notation, and then covers measurements, entanglement, and time-evolution, with spin-states as practical examples. The discussion on Bell’s theorem is more conceptual than detailed. Readers who complete the book should have a good grasp of Bell’s theorem. The later chapters introduce the general wave function for particles, the Schrödinger equation, the derivation of the uncertainty principle, and a brief look at path integrals. The book concludes with a section on the harmonic oscillator, hinting at quantum field theory.\n\nWant to taste a little weirdness? Keep Reading (Grab a Pencil, I’ve freestyled a bit.)\n\n### **Systems and Experiments**\n\n> The spin of an electron is about as quantum mechanical as a system can be, and any attempt to visualize it classically will badly missed the point.\n\nThe isolated quantum spin exemplifies a broader class of simple systems known as qubits. Susskind discusses an experiment where the first interaction with the apparatus prepares the system in one of two states. Subsequent experiments confirm this state. During the experiment, changes in sigma suggest that sigma represents a degree of freedom associated with a directional sense in space. Were we to conceive of a spin vector, it would logically be described by three components (sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z).\n\nFor example, if we prepare the state sigma_z as +1 and then measure sigma_x, classical expectations would suggest a result around 0. However, the actual measurement of sigma_x consistently yields either +1 or -1. Only the average of these repeated measurements behaves classically — as the expectation value is 0.\n\n> Each experiment is invasive; measuring one spin component obliterates information about another.\n\nThen, Susskind talks about classical and quantum propositions. Say, proposition A is the z component of the spin is +1, and proposition B is the x component of the spin is +1. Let’s say the unknown agent has set things up. Then we discover that sigma_z equals +1, and now we know that (A or B) is true. But, now let’s reverse the order of measurement, starting with measuring sigma_x; if it turns out that sigma_x equals +1 are finished, (B or A) is true. Suppose we find the opposite result, sigma_x equals -1. So now, with a probability of 1/4, we find that (B or A) is false. This occurs despite the fact that the hidden agent had originally made sure that sigma_z equals +1. Inclusive OR is not symmetric in quantum mechanics. This defies classical logic, as the truth of propositions (A or B) may depend on the order of their confirmation. Worse, (A and B) is not even confirmable. In quantum physics, the second part of an experiment can interfere with confirming the first part. Thus, propositions like ‘the particle has position X’ or ‘the particle’s momentum is Y’ become meaningless.\n\nSusskind then introduces mathematical concepts, starting with dual number systems and the phase factor as a complex number whose real component is 1. He describes entities with magnitude and direction in space as 3-vectors. Vector spaces used to define quantum mechanical states are called Hilbert spaces, which may have a finite or infinite number of dimensions. 3-vectors form a real vector space, while bras and kets form a complex vector space. Susskind also discusses inner products and orthonormal basis. The dimension of a space is defined as the maximum number of mutually orthogonal vectors it can contain.\n\n### Quantum States\n\n> Knowing a quantum state means knowing as much as can be known about how the system was prepared.\n\nIf the apparatus is oriented along the Z axis, the two possible states that can be prepared correspond to sigma_z equals +1 or -1. Let's call them up and down and denote them by ket-vectors u and d. If the apparatus is oriented along the X-axis and registers -1, the state |l> has been prepared.\n\n> The idea that there are no hidden variables has a very simple mathematical representation: the space of states for a single spin has only two dimensions.\n\nTo describe any quantum state of the spin, we choose |u> and |d> as the two basis vectors. Any state can then be written as a linear combination of these two. The components of such a state vector are probability amplitudes, which, when squared, give the probability of finding the electron in that state upon measurement. It’s important to note that the state vector represents the potential outcomes of a measurement, not the actual values obtained from the measurement. Furthermore, the terms ‘up’ and ‘down’ in this context should not be mistaken for literal directions in space; they are simply labels associated with the state vectors in the abstract space of quantum states.\n\n### **The Perfect Transition to Real Science**\n\nSo, I’m going to go ahead and assume that you breezed through the above paragraphs, and everything made total sense. But hey, if it didn’t, that’s totally okay. Just grab a copy of this book and just let it hang out on your shelf. You never know; one day, you might be as bored as I was and decide to give it a _spin_ (pun intended.)\n\nBut, when you finally close this book, you’ll realize you’re not just flipping through Pop-Sci stuff anymore. You’ve stepped up to the real-deal science. It’s like signing off from your Pop-Sci Era — a fitting end, _a perfect transition_. Making it through this book isn’t easy. It’s like a hike up a steep hill — tough for sure, but the view at the top? This is what you were depriving yourself of by reading only Pop-Sci.\n\n[**The Theoretical Minimum**  \n_The Theoretical Minimum is a series of Stanford Continuing Studies courses taught by world renowned physicist Leonard…_theoreticalminimum.com](https://theoreticalminimum.com/ \"https://theoreticalminimum.com/\")[](https://theoreticalminimum.com/)\n\nI am leaving a link to the website to accompany the lectures in the book!

          "raw": "## Questions of My Shadow\n\nI believe most analyses of _Thus Spoke Zarathustra_ already exist, and try to explain what Nietzsche meant, but I don’t think that’s what the book really demands from its reader. I have read about Nietzsche earlier, but hadn’t read his work myself. So this is not a breakdown of Nietzsche’s philosophy. Instead, these are the questions that began to form while I read—six small residues that felt like the real aftermath of the book.\n\n1. **Do philosophers/saints attain wisdom to teach/preach by sitting alone and reasoning with themselves?**  \n   The image of the wise person in isolation has always had a mythical pull, as if solitude were sacred in itself. But solitude can amplify you just as easily as it can trap you. The figures we remember—Zarathustra, Socrates, Christ—return from solitude. They speak, argue, get interrupted. Whatever “wisdom” they have crystallizes only after it collides with other people. Solitude may give you the first version of your thoughts, but you need the world to sand them down. If anything, Zarathustra made me suspicious of wisdom that never leaves the cave.\n\n2. **How do we know if an author intended to be symbolic or was being literal?**  \n   Zarathustra forced me to ask this constantly. Visions, animals, laughter, masks—was it dogma or metaphor? Traditions have long wrestled with this. Augustine said to read metaphorically when literal readings broke reason. Buddhism differentiates definitive and interpretable teachings. Genre, context, and lineage matter, and Zarathustra clearly stands in the parabolic, mythic camp. Authorial intent may be unknowable, so the better test is whether a symbolic reading opens more doors than it closes. When I read certain passages literally, they collapsed. Read as metaphor, they began to breathe.\n\n3. **Do philosophers/saints have an ego when disciples raise a valid point?**  \n   Zarathustra doesn’t sound ego-free. He leaves people, returns on his own terms, gets frustrated when misunderstood. But the deeper question is what happens when a teacher is challenged. Traditions idealize egoless sages—Sāriputta thanking a child for correction, Confucius learning from every person he meets—but history shows that pride persists even in the wise. The real measure isn’t ego’s presence; it’s how someone reacts to being wrong. Zarathustra hovers in that ambiguous space: not immune to ego, not consumed by it. Human, in other words.\n\n4. **Was the concept of the soul meant to be literal?**  \n   Many cultures treated the soul as literal—Plato’s eternal essence, Hinduism’s ātman, Christianity’s moral unit. But early Hebrew thought equated “soul” with breath; Buddhism denies a self altogether. Modern science relegates the soul to metaphor. The term persists because it gestures at something hard to name. Zarathustra nudged me to ask not what the soul _is_, but why I keep needing one.\n\n5. **What if solitude is just comfort?**  \n   Zarathustra retreats often. I admired that. Maybe envied it.

          "raw": "## Personal Anecdote\n\nI remember this one afternoon when I was in my professor’s office, asking for a correction on my quiz marks. He was an old man, but one of those beloved management professors everyone calls a “gem.” The kind who teaches the hard courses people voluntarily sign up for, just to feel like they’re really learning something. While I sound like I’m mocking that, I was absolutely one of them.\n\nNow, asking for marks wasn’t my thing (I wasn’t “that guy”). But this time, I truly believed I had a case. I walked in with the kind of confidence you only get when you’re both right and also mildly offended that someone didn’t notice. We talked. About the quiz, yes, but also about life, purpose, goals—your standard issue life lecture, gently inserted into the conversation like a complimentary mint from old professors in linen shirts.\n\nEventually, after I showed him that my solution made sense and maybe his TAs were just a little off, he smiled and said, “You should read _To Kill a Mockingbird_.” That summer, while aimlessly window shopping with friends, someone pointed at a copy and said it was their all-time favorite. That sealed it. So, I picked it up.\n\n## First Impressions\n\nAnd you know what? It’s an easy book. Clean writing, super simple words, chapters that fly by. Honestly, it makes sense that it’s taught in American high schools. I finished it in five days, with no effort. For comparison, I once spent those same five days getting through ten percent of _Moby-Dick_. That book makes you stop and reread multiple times, due to its diverse word choice and complex narrative styles. On the contrary, Lee’s writing is smooth. Maybe too smooth.\n\nThe first ten chapters set up an eerie, small-town mystery around Boo Radley. I was into it. I thought it was going somewhere dark and strange. But then, out of nowhere, the story takes a hard turn and becomes a courtroom drama about a Black man falsely accused of rape. The Boo storyline just fades. If I’d read this in school, I might’ve thought Boo was the villain and the moral was “don’t kill Black people,” and honestly, I’d have failed the test.\n## Hypocritic Portrayal\n\nNow, Atticus Finch, a.k.a. The Quote Machine. There’s a moment that still feels off. Scout, who is eight years old, suggests that her brother Jem might’ve killed Bob Ewell. Atticus, their father, doesn’t pause. Doesn’t question it. Just accepts that his son may have murdered someone. No moment of reflection, no “maybe she’s confused,” nothing. That’s just absolutely terrible parenting. You’d think a father would stop for a second and defend his son, but no sir, he’s a lawyer and too moral for questioning a hazy claim made by a child after she got mugged by a stranger and was scared half to death. In fact, he immediately wanted to take his son to court himself, before the sheriff, who was far more emotionally intelligent, told him to shut the hell up and go back inside the house.\n\nAnd more broadly, Atticus isn’t quite the hero he’s made out to be. Yes, he defends Tom Robinson. But he never really challenges the system that’s clearly crushing him. He follows the rules, even when the rules are the problem. His quiet nobility feels more like polite compliance. He gives a nudge to his son Jem that maybe he can change the law someday, but his tone was way too realist and rule-abiding to actually be encouraging to a teenage kid.\n\n## Back to the Publishing Year\n\nHarper Lee was a white woman from the Deep South. Came from money. Studied law. Was close with Truman Capote. Her draft got heavily edited by Tay Hohoff at J.B. Lippincott & Co., who helped turn it into the tidy little morality tale it became.\n\nHere’s my humble opinion: _Mockingbird_ isn’t brave. It’s just neat in a way that makes it feel safe. And that safety? That’s exactly why it blew up. The book gives you racism, but it filters it through the eyes of a white child and her noble father. Meanwhile, Tom Robinson, the Black man at the center of the whole story, barely gets a voice. He’s treated like a stand-in, the symbolic mockingbird of the story.\n\nWhen Atticus quotes:\n\n> “Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ’em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”\n\nAnd Miss Maudie adds:\n\n> “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but make music for us to enjoy … That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”\n\nIt almost suggests that Black people exist merely to serve the growth arcs of noble white characters, accepting them as mere tools rather than human beings. He’s there to suffer so other people can learn something.\n\nStill, the book won awards. Got a movie. Entered classrooms. I wondered why.\n\nA lot of that has to do with timing. It showed up right when the Civil Rights Movement was gaining traction, and white America was starting to feel uncomfortable. _Mockingbird_ offered just enough weight to feel important, but not enough to actually challenge anyone. You feel sad. You nod. You move on. No confrontation. No reckoning. Just a story that lets you feel kind without being shaken. To be fair, it does a few things well. The setting is vivid. The child’s perspective feels authentic. The prose is smooth. But the fact that this book is still treated as _the_ book about race in America? That says way more about institutional fear around that time than literary greatness.\n\nMeanwhile, during that same era, Black writers were going all in and getting ignored. Zora Neale Hurston died broke. James Baldwin was told to dial it down. Richard Wright got pushed out for being too political. They told the truth in ways that made people squirm. _Mockingbird_ made people feel safe. That’s why it stuck.\n\n## Afterthoughts\n\nLook, I get it. Books hit differently depending on when you read them. I’m 22. I’ve grown up watching documentaries, movies, and media that deal with race, cynicism, and injustice far more directly than this book ever does. So maybe I’m not the audience anymore.\n\nBut even so, I wouldn’t hand this book to a kid today. It’s outdated. Its politics are mild. And from a writing point of view, it doesn’t take any real risks. No bold structure. Just a smooth, quiet story designed not to offend. If a book becomes a classic because it comforted people during a tough time, fine. But don’t mistake that comfort for courage, which is what literature at its best can do.\n",

          "raw": "During the winter break, I decided to devote some time to reading and stumbled upon “Understanding Deep Learning” (UDL) by Simon J.D. Prince. While searching for the most authoritative and standard textbooks on deep learning, I was soon struck with the realization that having updated information in a rapidly changing field is important. This understanding steered me towards Prince’s book, setting it apart from older, more established works like Ian Goodfellow’s “Deep Learning.”\n\nIn a field like this, where progress is swift and unrelenting, a book that’s been recently updated becomes a crucial source of knowledge. It’s as if the hard work has already been done for you, with the intricate and growing realm of deep learning knowledge being efficiently compiled and distilled into a singular, accessible guide. This is the essence of UDL. The book presents a straightforward, no-frills view of the most current ideas, trends, and technological breakthroughs in AI. In the next few paragraphs, I’ll talk about this book and its contents in brief, with cool illustrations.\n\n### Overview of chapters\n\nUDL’s Chapter 1 kicks off with supervised learning, then quickly jumps to unsupervised learning and generative models, showcasing current cool stuff like inpainting and GPT-3 conditional text synthesis. It introduces latent variables (because, why not?) and has some fun with a teddy bear on a skateboard (DALL-E 2). This chapter is visually packed and even sneaks in a bit on reinforcement learning and ethics — kind of a ‘be responsible’ nod, a la Andrew Ng. It’s a solid base for newbies and feels like home for AI techbro. (And hey, it even includes a reading list for all these topics!)\n\nChapter 2 of UDL, titled ‘Supervised Learning,’ is concise. It provides an overview of supervised learning and delves into a linear regression example, wrapping up quickly.\n\nChapter 3, ‘Shallow Neural Networks,’ starts with a neural network example and covers the Universal Approximation Theorem. It also discusses multivariate inputs and outputs, providing a comprehensive overview of shallow neural networks, including terminology, and concludes with summary and notes. (did I tell that the illustrations are just beautiful?)\n\nChapter 4, ‘Deep Neural Networks,’ takes the reader further into the complexities of AI. It begins with composing neural networks, transitions into the nuances of deep networks, and discusses deep neural networks in detail, including matrix notation and a comparison between shallow and deep neural networks. This chapter culminates with a summary, offering a clear understanding of the subject.\n\nThe middle chapters (5 to 8) of UDL are particularly notable for their practical orientation. These chapters cover critical elements such as loss functions, model training, and performance evaluation. Chapter 8 introduces and discusses newer concepts like double descent (on how bias-variance tradeoff is a thing of the past in overparameterized models that we can have today).\n\nUDL then steers into advanced territory, encompassing chapters on convolutional and residual networks, transformers, and graph neural networks (Chapters 10 to 13). It’s here that you (or at least I did) realize these topics are vast fields in themselves, deserving entire books. The four chapters in UDL are impressively concise and provide a solid primer, but they also make it clear that dedicated, in-depth reading in each area would be beneficial. For anyone eager to dive deeper, the notes section is a treasure trove. It’s brilliantly organized, subtopic-wise, and includes references to pivotal papers, allowing readers to explore these subjects at the source level (again, the illustrations of architectures, computational graphs, and examples are just fantastic in these chapters).\n\nThe latter part of UDL (Chapters 14 to 19) delves into unsupervised learning, generative models, and deep reinforcement learning, addressing complex topics such as GANs, normalizing flows, variational autoencoders, diffusion models. These chapters not only offer an in-depth understanding of these advanced methods but also highlight their practical applications across various fields. (be prepared for even more math here, but rest assured, you can do it!)\n\nUDL concludes with thought-provoking discussions in its final chapters. Chapter 20 explores the fundamental question of why deep learning is so effective, and Chapter 21 rounds off the book with a critical examination of the ethical dimensions of AI. This comprehensive approach, encompassing both the technical intricacies and ethical aspects, positions UDL as an all-encompassing resource for anyone eager to grasp the current landscape and future directions of deep learning.\n\n### Whom Is This Book For?\n\nUDL starts off as an undergraduate-level textbook, but it doesn’t stop there. It’s crafted to guide readers from the foundational aspects of the field right through to the more complex and advanced topics. The book breaks down these sophisticated concepts with clear explanations and practical examples, making them more approachable. (And for those who want to dive even deeper, the notes and reading lists at the end of each chapter are a rich resource for further exploration. pure gold.)\n\nWhat sets UDL apart is its broad appeal. It’s not just for undergrad students; it offers insights and knowledge that cater to a wide audience. Whether you’re a beginner just starting to explore AI, a student delving deeper into your studies, a developer handling AI in the real world, or a researcher pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, UDL has something for you. It ties together the vast area of deep learning into a narrative that is both understandable and engaging. (Plus, the visual aspects of the book add an extra layer of learning, making complex topics not only accessible but also visually engaging.)\n\n[**udlbook**  by Simon J.D.

While searching for the most authoritative and standard textbooks on deep learning, I was soon struck with the realization that having updated information in a rapidly changing field is important. This understanding steered me towards Prince’s book, setting it apart from older, more established works like Ian Goodfellow’s “Deep Learning.” In a field like this, where progress is swift and unrelenting, a book that’s been recently updated becomes a crucial source of knowledge. It’s as if the hard work has already been done for you, with the intricate and growing realm of deep learning knowledge being efficiently compiled and distilled into a singular, accessible guide. This is the essence of UDL. The book presents a straightforward, nofrills view of the most current ideas, trends, and technological breakthroughs in AI. In the next few paragraphs, I’ll talk about this book and its contents in brief, with cool illustrations.",
